## Documentation

## Introduction

### Our goals

1. Domain conduction
2. Productivity
3. Intelligent education

See roadmaps (ryuujo1573/OpenCampus#1).

### Why another campus / education solution?

This idea is suggested with the following goals:

1. To introduce a patent-free, open-source solution
2. To abstract complex business logics
3. To scale with institution size.
4. To support schools in conserving their funds.

### Future plans

**Open source and easy to access.**

Introducing a free, open-source solution to education can democratize access to resources and foster innovation.

Implementing suitable abstractions during design will help tackle complex business challenges effectively.

Prioritizing open-source over profit-driven models can create a more inclusive and sustainable ecosystem, benefiting a broader audience and encouraging community-driven development.

Community managed development, with the vast on campus students who are interested in improving shared experiences and/or practicing team-collaboration and large-scale application development, is highly appreciated.
