## Why another campus / education solution?

中文省流：一时兴起，还没开头但大概率烂尾的垃圾项目，属于那种张口就来的idea，不建议浪费时间阅读：

**EN**''

I came up with this idea mainly considering the following points:

1. Can we build up a SaaS Education solution as a common affair?
2. How good are we for abstracting gigantic education e-flow requirements?
3. What scale does it extend?
4. Why should we build a new one instead of committing existing ones?



## The root cause

**Open source and cost-free.**

Community managed development, with the vast on campus students who are interested in improving shared experiences and/or practicing team-collaboration and large-scale application development, is highly appreciated.



## The very first step

To make sure everything realizable, we need to pave the tiles for those may become interested to evaluate and start.



The very first step to take, is keeping things cool and fun.

We can start to iterate through these procedures 

1. Architecture design
2. Workflow setup
3. Forum (discuss & survey)
