## Documentation

For developers, see [documentations](./docs/index.md).

## Introduction

### Our goals

1. Domain conduction
2. Productivity
3. Intelligent education

See roadmaps #1.

### Why another campus / education solution?

I developed this idea by pondering the following questions:

1. Can we introduce a patent-free, open-source solution to the educational sector?
2. Can we implement suitable abstractions during the design phase to tackle complex business challenges?
3. What is the potential scale of this solution?
4. Why should we prioritize open-source solutions over profit-driven models in the industry?

### The root cause

**Open source and easy to access.**

Introducing a free, open-source solution to education can democratize access to resources and foster innovation.

Implementing suitable abstractions during design will help tackle complex business challenges effectively.

Prioritizing open-source over profit-driven models can create a more inclusive and sustainable ecosystem, benefiting a broader audience and encouraging community-driven development.

Community managed development, with the vast on campus students who are interested in improving shared experiences and/or practicing team-collaboration and large-scale application development, is highly appreciated.

## The very first step

To make sure everything realizable, we need to pave the tiles for those may become interested to evaluate and start.

The very first step to take, is keeping things cool and fun.

We can start to iterate through these procedures

1. Architecture design
2. Workflow setup
3. Forum (discuss & survey)
