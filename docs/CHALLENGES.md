# OpenCampus - Challenges



## About challenges

Yes, for a newly initiated opensource project, along with its gigantic systems, there is no easy thing to deal with. Simply put: when will this project make some progress? The answer is, well I don't know. But I care about how will we make progress. Things will be done. And to remember, Rome wasn't built in one day.



## Overall Plans

Recently I may come up with the very first architecture design, which is likely to be a much simple one. All designs should/would be discussed and rectified as needed.



Milestone 0: IdP+ Authorization
